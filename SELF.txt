This work is currently hosted on GitHub at http://github.com/countvajhula/identity. The hope is that in the near future a publicly-owned, decentralized identity architecture will be implemented, and this work will be established there (which may not necessarily involve a change in hosting. The IA would ideally incorporate all existing websites non-cannibalistically) along with all other extant and future works.
