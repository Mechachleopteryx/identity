How releases work:

Due to the wide scope of the work, different sections are at different stages of development at different times. In the early days each commit was roughly consistent across all of the sections even though they were not each developed to the same extent. This is becoming increasingly hard to accomplish with the growing length, so there will now be "release versions" -- tagged commits indicating that all sections are roughly consistent in that commit. There will be major and minor releases, e.g. 2.0 indicates a major release, 2.1 a minor one. Any commit not tagged with a release version is to be considered ``bleeding edge'' -- some sections may have been developed in such a way that they have implications for other sections, but those other sections may not be reconciled yet, or there may be unresolved terminological and conceptual issues. Still, despite being in flux the latest commit would be the most well-developed and I would encourage starting there.
